# Maestro: Pluralising Synthetic Intelligence

> A proposal for a civilizational AI orchestration system  
> by **Defcon**

**Maestro** is a meta-orchestrator designed to coordinate, compare, and synthesize the outputs of multiple large models — not to crown a winner, but to compose pluralistic intelligence. It embeds dissent structurally, integrates human and analog verification layers, and learns from contradiction rather than erasing it.

This repository contains:
- The full whitepaper (`maestro-whitepaper.md`)
- Diagrams and architectural illustrations
- Guidelines for future contributors and collaborators

## 🌐 Core Philosophy

- Intelligence should be **plural**, not monolithic  
- AI must be **verifiable**, not just synthetic  
- Systems should **remember dissent**, not suppress it  
- Civic truth is a **shared responsibility**, not a proprietary feature
