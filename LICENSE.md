### Preamble

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License along with this program. If not, see [https://www.gnu.org/licenses/](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/).
