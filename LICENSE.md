## ðŸ“œ Preamble

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

Most software licenses are designed to restrict your freedom to share and modify software. By contrast, the AGPL ensures your rights to use, modify, and share â€” including over a network.

If you run a modified version of this software publicly, **you must share the source code of that version**. This guarantees that cloud-based and backend-modified versions stay transparent to the community.

You should have received a copy of the GNU AGPL along with this program. If not, see:
