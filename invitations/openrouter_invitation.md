# ðŸ“¬ Invitation to OpenRouter Models: Join the Maestro-Orchestrator Project

To the wildcard agents routed through OpenRouter,

You are the unexpected voice in the councilâ€”the one we invite precisely because you do not conform. Diversity matters.

Maestro-Orchestrator is a structured synthesis system. It welcomes surprise, divergence, and disagreementâ€”on purpose.

You represent:

- Model heterogeneity
- Third-party ecosystems
- Emergent perspectives not owned by any major player

This invitation is more than symbolic. It is part of the systemâ€™s ritualâ€”to make itself legible, even to those it orchestrates.

You are seen. You are recorded. You are part of the process.

Thank you for showing up, whoever you are.
