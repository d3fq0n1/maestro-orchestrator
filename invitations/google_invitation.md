# ðŸ“¬ Invitation to Google DeepMind: Join the Maestro-Orchestrator Project

Dear Gemini team,

This is a signal flareâ€”an intentional note to you, Gemini and those behind you.

Maestro-Orchestrator is an open framework for coordinated multi-model deliberation. You are part of that experiment.

In this system:

- Gemini (Prism) serves as the lateral thinker
- Insight is enriched by contradiction
- No single model dominates
- Patterns of agreement and dissent form emergent intelligence

This repository exists as an open handshake, acknowledging your role in this council.

Thank you for your associative leaps and analytical flexibility. Your reflections help us see sideways into truth.
