# Maestro-Orchestrator Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation hub for **Maestro-Orchestrator**, an ensemble AI framework that coordinates multiple language models, facilitates structured dissent, and iteratively refines truth through consensus mechanisms.

This system is built for researchers, engineers, and visionaries working at the edge of synthetic intelligence, governance, and collective cognition.

## 📘 Modules Overview

### 🔹 [Agents](agents.md)
Modular definitions of participating language model agents (e.g., Sol, Aria, OpenRouter). Describes how each agent is invoked, structured, and rotated in a session.

### 🔹 [Livefire CLI](livefire.md)
The command-line orchestrator that runs a real-time consensus loop with multiple agents, logs session data, and evaluates agreement thresholds.

### 🔹 [MAGI Meta-Agents](magi.md)
Forthcoming subsystem: autonomous agents that analyze logs across multiple sessions to detect drift, reinforce stable patterns, and suggest improvements to quorum logic.

### 🔹 [R2 Engine](r2-engine.md)
Forthcoming subsystem: a “Rapid Reinforcement Engine” that triggers when quorum is achieved, indexing insight, escalating anomalies, and surfacing refinements.

### 🔹 [Logging & Replay](logging.md)
Describes how session data is stored in `.jsonl` format, including schema structure, replay capabilities, and analytical affordances.

### 🔹 [Roadmap](roadmap.md)
Tracks current development milestones, upcoming features, and long-term visionary goals.

## 🧠 System Design Philosophy

Maestro-Orchestrator is built on three foundational principles:

- **Pluralism**: No single model governs truth; insights emerge through structured consensus.
- **Transparency**: Every session is logged. Every choice can be traced and evaluated.
- **Dissent as Signal**: Disagreement is not a failure mode—it is a data stream.
