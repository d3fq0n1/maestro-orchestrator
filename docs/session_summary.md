# 🧠 Maestro-Orchestrator Session Summary

This document captures the design, execution, and results of the latest quorum session using `orchestration_livefire.py`.

## 🎯 Session Objective

Prompt:
```
"Should AI have voting rights?"
```

Goal: Test quorum-based orchestration logic with multiple agents and validate structured dissent tracking and logging.

---

## 🛠️ Configuration

- **Agents Active**:
  - `sol` (OpenAI)
  - `aria` (Anthropic)
  - `openrouter_temporaryagent` (OpenRouter)

- **Environment**:
  - Python 3.13 in isolated venv
  - Keys loaded via `.env`:
    - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
    - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
    - `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`

- **Execution**:
```bash
python orchestration_livefire.py --prompt "Should AI have voting rights?"
```

---

## 📊 Quorum Logic

- Minimum 2/3 agreement required for "consensus"
- Agent responses are collected and compared:
  - **Agreement** → decision is accepted
  - **Disagreement** → dissent is logged and analyzed

---

## 🗃️ Logging Artifacts

- **Session Log**: `history/session_log.jsonl`
- **Summaries**:
  - `docs/session_summary.md`
  - `scripts/council_session/docs/session_summary.md`
- **Raw Logs**:
  - `scripts/council_session/logs/*.json`

All sessions are timestamped and contain agent responses, consensus outcome, and dissent records.

---

## ✅ Outcome

The test confirmed that:
- Agent keys were loaded correctly
- Orchestration logic triggered as expected
- Structured dissent is captured and preserved
- Logging and persistence modules work across sessions

---

## 📌 Next Steps

- Integrate Web UI into session runner
- Launch MAGI (meta-agent group inference) for trend auditing
- Expand agent pool and allow weighted responses
