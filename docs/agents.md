# Agent Roles – Maestro-Orchestrator

**Version:** v0.2-webui
**Status:** Containerized and Modular
**Last Updated:** 2025-06-05
**Maintainer:** defcon

Maestro-Orchestrator integrates multiple LLM agents via a containerized backend and frontend system. This document outlines the roles and routing logic for each agent within the orchestrated council.

---

## Containerized Deployment Context

As of `v0.2-webui`, agents operate within a modular, container-friendly system:

- The **FastAPI backend** routes prompts to individual agents based on configuration
- The **React/Vite frontend** displays all agent responses and quorum status
- Agents are defined in Python as modular handlers with consistent schema
- Role randomization is handled within container execution, not hardcoded

## Current Agent Council

| ID          | Codename   | Backed By           | Description                                  |
|-------------|------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `sol`       | Sol        | OpenAI (GPT-4)      | Language-first anchor and orchestrator       |
| `aria`      | Aria       | Claude (Anthropic)  | Moral and philosophical lens                 |
| `prism`     | Prism      | Gemini (Google)     | Analytical and pattern-focused perspective   |
| `tempagent` | TempAgent  | OpenRouter (varied) | Rotating agent for external model injection  |

## Role Randomization Logic

- Session-based rotation prevents static role alignment
- Reduces echo chamber effects across repeated sessions
- Implemented in orchestration logic, not frontend or fixed backend mapping

---

## API Behavior

Each agent receives the same prompt via `/api/ask`, responds independently, and contributes to:

- Raw response log
- Quorum evaluation
- Consensus summary

All responses are displayed in the frontend UI alongside a computed consensus outcome.

---

## Future Agents

- Multilingual agents (French, Spanish, etc.)
- Image-captioning or visual interpretation models
- Audio transcription or multimodal comprehension agents
- Simulated agents for adversarial testing

---

## Notes for Devs

- Defined in `maestro/agents/` as modular classes extending a shared base
- Loaded dynamically into containerized FastAPI app
- Must conform to response schema:
```json
{
  "agent_name": "sol",
  "response": "string",
  "token_usage": { "prompt_tokens": 0, "completion_tokens": 0, "total_tokens": 0 }
}
```
