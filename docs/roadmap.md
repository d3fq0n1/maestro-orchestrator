## 🚧 Active Development (v0.3 Goals)

- 📊 **Dissent Analysis** – Track and visualize disagreements in agent outputs
- 🧬 **Reinforcement Loop** – Feed consensus outcomes into fine-tuning or snapshot logs
- 🧱 **UI Enhancements** – Add tooltips, loading indicators, and error handling
- 📂 **Session History Logging** – Persist and replay orchestration sessions
- 🔎 **Drift Detection** – Meta-agent layer to compare outputs over time for stability
- 🧩 **Module Isolation** – Refactor agent logic into swappable, testable components

---

## 🌐 Planned Milestones

- 🌍 **Decentralized Consensus Layer** – Future module allowing cross-host quorum
- 💡 **Public Demo Endpoint** – Limited-use hosted version with transparent logging
- 📘 **Expanded Documentation** – Add markdown docs on quorum theory, dissent modeling
- 🧑‍💻 **Contributor Onboarding** – Launch `CONTRIBUTING.md` with examples and task tags
- 💬 **Multilingual Agent Support** – Introduce language specialization agents
