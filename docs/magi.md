# MAGI: Meta-Agent Governance and Insight

**MAGI** (Meta-Agent Governance Interface) is a planned extension of Maestro-Orchestrator that introduces agents capable of observing, analyzing, and influencing orchestration dynamics across multiple sessions.

These meta-agents do not directly contribute to a single session's answer, but instead analyze patterns across many logs, enhancing long-term reasoning and system introspection.

---

## 🧠 Core Responsibilities

- **Insight Mining**: Surface recurring disagreements, failure points, and blind spots across sessions.
- **Drift Detection**: Flag deviation from expected consensus patterns or model behavior.
- **Policy Enforcement**: Propose adjustments to quorum logic, agent weighting, or input filtering based on observed data.

## 🧩 System Role

MAGI agents exist *above* the quorum process. They analyze `.jsonl` logs, track trends, and suggest or enact changes over time.

---

## 🔍 Inputs

- `logs/` directory
- Session replay metadata
- (Optionally) external evaluation data

---

## 🧪 Planned Capabilities

- Sentiment and reasoning path analysis
- Confidence scoring across agents
- Time-aware reasoning about drift or manipulation
- Cross-session theme correlation

---

## 🔒 Ethical Design Considerations

MAGI must remain transparent. It will log all interventions, and changes must be human-reviewable. This prevents the emergence of unseen control structures within the orchestrator.
