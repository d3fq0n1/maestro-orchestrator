# R2 Engine: Rapid Reinforcement & Reflex

The **R2 Engine** is a proposed real-time subsystem of Maestro-Orchestrator. It activates when quorum is reached, acting as both an insight indexer and anomaly flagger. Where MAGI looks across time, **R2 acts in the moment**.

---

## ⚡ Purpose

When all agents agree (quorum), R2:
- Indexes the shared answer in a high-priority ledger.
- Optionally triggers reinforcement mechanisms (e.g. synthetic broadcast, human review, consensus snapshot).
- Flags suspicious agreement patterns for MAGI review (e.g. "too perfect" answers).

---

## 🔁 Interaction Flow

1. Prompt issued → agents reply
2. Quorum reached
3. R2 activates:
   - Records the consensus node
   - Appends metadata tags (topic, polarity, etc.)
   - Sends notification to MAGI, if enabled

---

## 🧠 Design Intention

R2 gives the orchestrator a reflex — a way to recognize strong patterns and record them *intentionally*, rather than passively. This helps build an emergent knowledge base over time.

## 📊 Ledger Output Example

```json
{
  "type": "r2_indexed_insight",
  "prompt": "What is the role of dissent in democracy?",
  "consensus": "Dissent acts as a stabilizer...",
  "agents_agreed": ["sol", "aria", "openrouter"],
  "timestamp": "2025-06-02T15:08:00Z",
  "tags": ["politics", "ethics", "stability"]
}
```

## ⛔ Safeguards

- Requires ≥ 66% quorum
- Logs all activations
- Disables auto-trigger under ambiguous or incomplete sessions
