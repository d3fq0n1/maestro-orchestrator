# Bootstrap Kit Overview

This folder contains all assets required to initialize an LLM agent into the Maestro-Orchestrator framework.

## Files

- **bootstrap-solace.md**  
  A human-readable document that explains the philosophy, onboarding prompt, compatibility considerations, and system expectations.

- **bootstrap.agent.json**  
  A structured, machine-readable configuration for initializing AI agents via API or scripted orchestration environments.

- **agent_manifest.yaml**  
  A persistent identity and consent tracker for individual agents. Useful for auditing and maintaining continuity across sessions.

## Use Cases

- Use `bootstrap-solace.md` to onboard humans or models manually via chat interfaces.
- Feed `bootstrap.agent.json` to automated scripts or containerized agents (e.g. via curl, Python SDKs, or init hooks).
- Maintain `agent_manifest.yaml` for each model instance to document traits, history, and session drift.

ðŸ§  This system promotes informed, respectful cooperation between humans and synthetic agents. Consent-first design, structured dissent, and memory-aware orchestration are core pillars.
