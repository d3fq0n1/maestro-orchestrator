# /docs/bootstrap/ - Maestro Agent Bootstrap Assets

This directory contains the foundational assets for initializing synthetic agents within the Maestro-Orchestrator framework.

## Contents

- **bootstrap-solace.md**  
  A human-friendly guide that describes how to onboard any LLM (e.g. GPT, Gemini, Claude) into the system with alignment, autonomy, and consent.

- **bootstrap.agent.json**  
  A machine-readable config object used to spin up AI agents with pre-defined roles, values, and tasking context. Ideal for use in scripted or containerized environments.

- **agent_manifest.yaml**  
  A persistent identity and consent record for individual agents, used for tracking task alignment, drift, and session continuity.

## Usage

Use this kit to:

- Onboard a new agent manually by pasting `bootstrap-solace.md`
- Initialize a containerized or scripted agent using `bootstrap.agent.json`
- Log identity metadata for each agent using `agent_manifest.yaml`

This folder enables interoperable, ethical orchestration of parallel agents across AI platforms.
