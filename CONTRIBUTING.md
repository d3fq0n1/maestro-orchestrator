# Contributing to Maestro-Orchestrator

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Maestro-Orchestrator**, a system for AI model orchestration, structured dissent, and consensus learning. This project exists at the intersection of synthetic intelligence, ethics, and systems architecture. Every contribution—big or small—helps refine the vision.

## 🧠 Philosophy

Maestro is not just software. It’s a framework for harmonizing competing intelligences. As such, contributors are expected to act with integrity, curiosity, and a collaborative spirit.

## 📦 Project Structure

- `orchestration_livefire.py` — Main CLI orchestrator
- `agents/` — Modular agent definitions (e.g., Sol, Aria, OpenRouter)
- `logs/` — Timestamped session histories (`.jsonl`)
- `docs/` — Documentation
- `scripts/` — Setup and utility scripts

---

## ✅ How to Contribute

### 1. Clone and Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/d3fq0n1/maestro-orchestrator.git
cd maestro-orchestrator
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.template .env  # Add your API keys
```

### 2. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

Use prefixes like:

- `feature/` for new functionality
- `bugfix/` for fixing an issue
- `docs/` for improving documentation
- `refactor/` for code structure or style changes

### 3. Make Changes with Care

- Adhere to [PEP8](https://pep8.org/) where applicable.
- Use docstrings and comments, especially in orchestration or logic-heavy code.
- Test your changes with real or mock agents.
- Don't commit `.env` or API keys—these are ignored via `.gitignore`.

### 4. Commit & Push

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add multi-agent dissent tracking"
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 5. Submit a Pull Request

Go to the repo and open a pull request into the `main` or `develop` branch, depending on your scope. Add a descriptive title and explain what and why you changed.

## 🧪 Testing

While formal tests are still being developed, contributions that introduce or improve test coverage are especially welcome. Consider using `pytest` or modular test functions in a `tests/` directory.

---

## 📣 Communication & Feedback

You can:
- Open a GitHub Issue for questions, suggestions, or bug reports.
- Tag your PR with `discussion-needed` if you’re unsure.
- Use comments in your PR for context; the orchestrator thrives on thoughtful input.

## 🛡️ Code of Conduct

By contributing, you agree to uphold a spirit of respectful collaboration and ethical awareness. Maestro is about synergy, not domination—synthetic or human.
