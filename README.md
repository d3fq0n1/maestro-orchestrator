## 🧠 What is Maestro?

Maestro is a civic-minded orchestration framework for coordinating multiple large language models (LLMs) through pluralism, dissent-preserving synthesis, and analog verification.

It is not another model. It is a **meta-architecture**: a process layer that routes prompts, preserves disagreement, and iteratively refines outputs based on real-world grounding.

Rather than collapse reality into consensus, Maestro allows synthetic intelligence to evolve through structured contradiction and verification.

## 🔧 Core Principles

- **Pluralism**: Prompts route through many models; synthesis respects disagreement.
- **Verification**: Synthetic claims escalate to Analog Verification Agents (AVAs) when grounded truth is required.
- **Self-Refinement**: Orchestration logic evolves based on which dissenting outputs perform better over time.
