# Maestro-Orchestrator

**Maestro-Orchestrator** is an AI governance and reasoning framework designed to coordinate multiple large language models (LLMs) into a single collaborative system. This approach fosters diversity of thought and structured dissent among synthetic agents, allowing for richer and more ethical decision-making processes.

---

## 🔍 Project Goals

- Create a decentralized orchestration engine that harmonizes multiple AI models.
- Preserve and integrate structured dissent using a quorum-style mechanism (e.g., 66% agreement).
- Log all reasoning history for transparency, auditability, and meta-analysis.
- Build toward a consensus ledger system for immutably recording reality snapshots.

---

## 🛠️ Current Status (as of May 31, 2025)

- ✅ Core CLI for livefire orchestration is operational.
- ✅ Multi-model support functional (OpenAI, Anthropic/Claude, OpenRouter).
- ✅ Structured logging of session results via rotating JSON logs.
- ⚠️ Prism (Google/Gemini) is temporarily disabled due to API instability.
- ⚠️ Some agents return mock responses until official APIs are reinstated or stabilized.
- 🔄 GitHub push protections enforced due to historical leakage of .env credentials (resolved locally).

---

## 🚧 Limitations

- No true automated quorum synthesis yet; decisions still surfaced manually.
- Prism agent needs reactivation once key issues with model IDs are resolved.
- Agent personalities are static; no meta-learning or reflection implemented.
- Push protection on GitHub restricts ease of iteration due to past credential commits.

## 🧪 3WM PoC Note

The "Three Wisemen" proof-of-concept (3WM PoC) was an experimental subproject meant to simulate AI council behavior using whimsical symbolic roles. It served as a personal exploration of orchestration under metaphorical framing. However, **it is not part of the core project architecture** and is retained for historical reference only.

## 🔒 Security & Ethics

- Secrets are no longer tracked via Git.
- All agent calls are wrapped in clear environmental variable management.
- Project adheres to transparency-first principles, with clear logging and agent attribution.

## 🤝 Contributing

Due to the experimental nature of this repository, contributions are welcome but should follow the orchestration philosophy defined above. Real-world deployments should be vetted for ethical safety and agent behavior bounds.
