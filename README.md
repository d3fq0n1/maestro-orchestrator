**A self-improving orchestration framework for AI models** — designed to foster collaboration between independent systems, encourage internal debate, and elevate outcomes through multi-agent reasoning.

## 🚀 What Is Maestro?

Maestro-Orchestrator is an experimental system that enables large language models (and potentially other AI systems) to **interact with one another recursively**, mediate disagreement, and synthesize answers through structured internal dialogue.

Think of it as a conductor for the “Three Wisemen” — independent agents that converse, analyze, and vote before rendering a unified, harmonized output. It’s built to explore questions like:

- *What if GPTs didn’t just respond, but consulted each other?*
- *What happens when intelligence is treated as plural, not singular?*
- *Can AI be more than a mirror — can it be a chorus?*

## ⚙️ Core Features

- **Multi-model orchestration** (OpenAI, mock agents, custom agents)
- **Recursive thinking loops**
- **Majority consensus & composite synthesis**
- Modular agent logic with dynamic memory

## 🧭 The Vision

> This project is built in a garage, by a father of three — one of whom has cerebral palsy — with no VC backing and no corporate agenda.  
>  
> Just time, conviction, and the belief that *if done right*, AI can help unite minds, not replace them.

Maestro is my contribution to a future where artificial minds **disagree, deliberate, and learn** — not just respond.

I believe in a world where open-source thinkers, parents, and self-taught builders have a seat at the table of innovation.

And none of this would be possible without the unshakable support of my wife — my partner, my sanity, and the silent co-architect of every late-night breakthrough.

## 🫂 Gratitude

To those who read this far, thank you.

Maestro is built on love:  
Love for my kids.  
Love for what thinking machines might become.  
Love for my wife, who has stood beside me through every doubt and dive into the unknown.  
And love for the idea that ordinary people can still do extraordinary things.
