# Maestro Orchestrator

Maestro is a modular orchestration framework designed to manage dissent and decision-making across large language models. It embodies a 66% quorum rule to ensure structured disagreement and avoid monolithic AI alignment.

## Project Goals
- Coordinate multiple intelligent agents
- Maintain structured dissent (Three Wisemen model)
- Enable consensus synthesis through quorum voting
- Build a planetary-scale truth synthesis framework

## Quickstart
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/d3fq0n1/maestro-orchestrator.git
   cd maestro-orchestrator
   ```

2. Run mock orchestration (example CLI coming soon):
   ```bash
   python orchestrator.py --agents 3 --quorum 66
   ```

3. Sync your local repo changes:
   ```powershell
   .\scripts\combosync.ps1
   ```

# Maestro-Orchestrator PoC: Three Wisemen

This proof-of-concept demonstrates a multi-agent AI orchestration system that combines the responses of multiple language models to produce a unified answer. Inspired by the wisdom of consensus, it highlights how distributed AI reasoning can outperform any individual agent.

## Features
- Multiple agent interfaces (mock, OpenAI, Claude)
- Aggregation strategies (voting, scoring)
- CLI interface for running queries

## Getting Started
To run the demo:
```bash
python scripts/run_maestro.py
```
