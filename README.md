# Maestro Orchestrator

Maestro is a modular orchestration framework designed to manage dissent and decision-making across large language models. It embodies a 66% quorum rule to ensure structured disagreement and avoid monolithic AI alignment.

## Project Goals
- Coordinate multiple intelligent agents
- Maintain structured dissent (Three Wisemen model)
- Enable consensus synthesis through quorum voting
- Build a planetary-scale truth synthesis framework

## Quickstart
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/d3fq0n1/maestro-orchestrator.git
   cd maestro-orchestrator
   ```

2. Run mock orchestration (example CLI coming soon):
   ```bash
   python orchestrator.py --agents 3 --quorum 66
   ```

3. Sync your local repo changes:
   ```powershell
   .\scripts\combosync.ps1
   ```
