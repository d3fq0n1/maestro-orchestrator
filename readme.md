# Maestro-Orchestrator

Maestro-Orchestrator is a novel orchestration system for synthetic intelligence. It enables multiple AI models to collaborate, disagree, and vote under quorum-based decision logic. Designed with structured dissent, persistent memory, and modular reasoning, it is a working proof-of-concept of ensemble artificial cognition.

## ✨ Features

- 🧠 **Multi-agent architecture** (`sol`, `aria`, `openrouter_temporaryagent`)
- 🗳️ **66% quorum logic** with disagreement handling
- 🖥️ **CLI orchestration via `orchestration_livefire.py`**
- 🔑 **Environment-driven API key management (`.env`)**
- 🧾 **Session history logging** to `.jsonl` for replay and analysis
- 🧩 **Pluggable agent structure** for expansion with new LLMs or logic
- 🧠 **Future MAGI integration** (meta-agents to audit/reflect on decisions)
- 🌐 **Upcoming web UI** in v0.2+

## 🔧 Quickstart

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/d3fq0n1/maestro-orchestrator.git
cd maestro-orchestrator
2. Set up Environment
Create a .env file in the root directory and add your API keys:

env
Copy
Edit
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...
3. Create a Virtual Environment
bash
Copy
Edit
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
4. Install Dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
5. Run a Livefire Quorum Session
bash
Copy
Edit
python orchestration_livefire.py --prompt "Should AI have voting rights?"
This will trigger all three agents to respond, evaluate quorum, and log the session results.

🧠 System Design Philosophy
Maestro is not a chatbot; it is an ensemble cognition experiment. No single model is trusted. Instead, multiple agents compete and collaborate to produce a consensus answer when 66% agree. All dissent is preserved. This protects against hallucination, bias, and overfitting to one provider's ideology.

When quorum is reached, the R2 Engine triggers — a reinforcement snapshot and session lock designed to solidify output, enabling meta-analysis by future components like the MAGI system.
