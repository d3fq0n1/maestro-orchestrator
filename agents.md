# Agent Guide: Maestro-Orchestrator

This document describes each AI agent integrated into Maestro-Orchestrator, including identity, API origin, and role in the system. Agents are designed to respond independently, contributing to quorum logic through structured reasoning.

## Agent Behavior

All agents receive the same prompt simultaneously and respond independently. No agent sees another's output during response generation.

---

## Technical Notes

- Each agent is initialized with its own API key from the `.env` file.
- Responses are retrieved asynchronously via HTTP API calls.
- Output is returned in a structured JSON object with agent name and content.
- Each response contributes to quorum consensus logic in `orchestrator_foundry.py`.

---

## Customization

To modify or extend agent behavior:

- Add or remove agents in `orchestrator_foundry.py`
- Update agent display emoji in `ui/src/maestroUI.tsx`
- Ensure proper `.env` keys are defined for each agent
- Re-run locally or rebuild the container for changes to take effect
