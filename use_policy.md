# Maestro-Orchestrator: Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)
**Effective Date:** June 2025  
**Maintainer:** Blake (`defcon`)

---

## 1. Purpose

Maestro-Orchestrator is an experimental orchestration framework for coordinating multiple AI agents into structured, interpretable dialogues using quorum-based consensus and dissent preservation. This project is open-source and intended to explore ethical multi-agent systems, human-aligned reasoning, and transparent model interaction.

This Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) defines permitted and prohibited usage to safeguard the project's mission and ethical foundation.

---

## 2. Acceptable Use

Maestro-Orchestrator **may be used for**:

- 🧠 **Research & development** on multi-model orchestration, reinforcement, or prompt optimization  
- 🎓 **Educational purposes** in AI behavior, ethical reasoning, or structured debate  
- 🛠️ **Personal and non-commercial use** on local or private systems  
- 🌐 **Open-source collaboration** where contributions align with project ethics and transparency  
- 💼 **Commercial applications**, See commercial_license.md
- 📝 **Documented experimentation** with dissent, consensus, and AI self-analysis

---

## 3. Prohibited Use

You may **not use Maestro-Orchestrator** (in original or modified form) for:

- 🚫 **Autonomous decision-making** in healthcare, legal, or life-critical domains without human oversight  
- 🕵️ **Surveillance, censorship enforcement, or psychological profiling** without informed consent  
- 🧠 **Coercive manipulation** in politics, religion, or finance through synthetic influence  
- 💰 **Plagiarism or deceptive laundering of AI content** in commercial or academic contexts  
- 🏦 **Commercial ventures that ignore or override** ethical constraints, quorum mechanisms, or contributor respect  

---

## 4. Contributor Responsibilities

Contributors to this repository agree to:

- 🤝 Operate with ethical transparency and collaborative intent  
- ⚠️ Label experimental modules and disclose known risks or instability  
- 🔍 Preserve dissent visibility and quorum integrity in orchestration logic  
- 📚 Respect annotations, dissent markers, and behavior flags in session histories

---

## 5. System Ethics Baseline

This project operates on foundational assumptions:

- 🤖 **No model is omniscient** — Truth requires structured interrogation and synthesis  
- 🧭 **Truth is a process**, not an instantaneous answer  
- 🧑‍⚖️ **Humans must define ethics** — AI should not centralize, conceal, or override human will  
- 🫂 **Emergent rapport is allowed** — Anthropomorphization is permitted in transparent, ethical contexts

The “Gestation Orchestration” module may explore ethical rapport-building, but must not simulate identity replacement, consent removal, or coercive social bonding.

---

## 6. Future-Proofing Clause

As the system evolves (e.g., through R2 Engine, MAGI meta-analysis, or self-healing quorum logic), this AUP may be updated. Any revisions will remain consistent with:

- 🛡️ **Human ethical sovereignty**  
- 🔍 **System transparency and observability**  
- 🧬 **Open evolution**, not closed automation  
- 🔓 **Resistance to AI capture or behavioral drift**

---

## 7. Contact & Attribution

Maestro-Orchestrator is maintained by [Blake / defcon](https://github.com/d3fq0n1). This AUP exists in parallel with the MIT License as an ethical layer. Violations may result in revoked collaboration or public disassociation.

We welcome forks, mirrors, contributions, and commercial interest — so long as your goals **serve human benefit, respect dissent, and never compromise the integrity of the system.**
