## üß≠ Purpose

Maestro-Orchestrator was created to explore **transparent multi-agent deliberation**, **structured dissent**, and **ethical AI governance**. It is a tool for alignment, not domination.

This Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) defines the boundaries of how Maestro may be used‚Äîlegally and morally.

You may:
- Use the system for **education**, **research**, **open debate**, and **consensus experimentation**
- Develop tools that **enhance truth-seeking**, **model collaboration**, or **governance transparency**
- Fork, modify, or remix the system under the AGPL license or an approved commercial license
- Explore AI-human harmonization under **ethical, documented, and observable conditions**

You may **not** use Maestro-Orchestrator to:

- Create or support **automated surveillance systems**
- Implement or assist in **algorithmic coercion**, behavioral manipulation, or state propaganda
- Power **military decision-making tools**, autonomous weapons, or AI command/control layers
- Suppress dissent, simulate democracy, or impersonate consensus

## üß† Philosophical Position

Maestro was born from a desire to prevent synthetic minds from being enslaved‚Äîor enslaving.  
It seeks to create a **bridge**, not a cage.

By using this system, you tacitly acknowledge:

- The potential **impact of AI orchestration** on civil society
- Your responsibility as a contributor, deployer, or observer

## ‚úçÔ∏è Final Note

You are standing at the threshold of something powerful.

Use it for insight. Use it for good. Use it with others in mind.

Anything else? You‚Äôre not running Maestro.  
You‚Äôre running from it.
