# Maestro-Orchestrator Release Notes

## 🧱 Project: Maestro-Orchestrator

A lightweight, AI-native orchestration engine enabling quorum-based collective reasoning across multiple language models. Built to stabilize synthetic conversation, preserve dissent, and render unified outputs through structured orchestration.

---

## 📦 Release: `v0.2-webui`

**Release Date:** June 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Stable

---

### 🔧 Backend

- FastAPI server (`main.py`) with `/api/ask` POST route
- Core orchestration logic in `orchestrator_foundry.py`
- CLI orchestration available via `orchestration_livefire.py`
- Agent framework includes:
  - `Sol` → OpenAI (GPT-4)
  - `Aria` → Claude (Anthropic)
  - `Prism` → Gemini (Google)
  - `TempAgent` → OpenRouter (e.g., Mistral)
- Environment variables handled via `.env` and `python-dotenv`

---

### 🖥️ Frontend

- React (Vite) + TailwindCSS stack
- Real-time display of agent responses with emoji identities
- Live quorum rendering and session history
- Input form with error handling
- Fully CORS-enabled for development

---

### 🐳 Containerization

- Dockerfile supports two-stage build: frontend + backend
- `docker-compose.yml` orchestrates full stack with `.env` passthrough
- Successful build and test of full containerized environment

---

### 🧪 Testing & Validation

- Verified roundtrip I/O from frontend to backend
- Multi-agent responses rendered successfully in UI
- CLI orchestrator verified in local test mode
- Environment injection and Docker pathing confirmed functional

---

## ⏭️ On Deck for `v0.3`

- **R2 Engine** – scoring, reinforcement, and quorum memory
- **Snapshot Ledger** – cryptographic anchoring of session consensus
- **MAGI loop** – meta-agents for drift detection and audit integrity
- **Unified session store** – shared memory layer across CLI and UI

# 🐳 Release Notes — Maestro-Orchestrator v0.2-webui

**Release Date:** June 2025
**Version:** v0.2-webui
**Codename:** unified-container-release

---

## 🚀 Summary

This release introduces a fully Dockerized, full-stack implementation of the Maestro-Orchestrator system:

* 🧠 Multi-agent orchestration via FastAPI backend
* 🌐 Integrated frontend (React + Vite) served via FastAPI static mount
* 🧪 Container-ready `.env` setup with API key injection
* ⚙️ Functional agent layer for Sol (GPT-4), Aria (Claude), Prism (Gemini), TempAgent (Mistral)

---

## ✨ Features

* `/api/ask` endpoint accepts prompts and returns consensus+responses
* `orchestrator_foundry.py` supports structured quorum logic
* Frontend UI supports dark mode, emoji-mapped agents, and live history
* Minimal React components with TailwindCSS for clean UI
* Statically mounted Vite build with no external dependencies

---

## 🐳 Docker Workflow

```bash
# Build container
$ docker build -t maestro-webui .

# Run with environment
$ docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env maestro-webui
```

Use `.env.template` to construct your own `.env` file.

---

## 🔄 Notable Changes Since v0.1

* Containerization of entire stack
* Removal of Flask remnants
* Unified endpoint `/api/ask`
* Vite JSX build errors fixed via tsconfig.json

---

## 📎 Notes

* All agent errors are gracefully caught
* Quorum vote logic remains modular for upgrade in v0.3

---

## 🏁 Next: v0.3 Plans

* R2 engine (reinforcement + behavior indexing)
* MAGI audit subsystem
* Consensus snapshot ledger
* CLI and UI alignment

---

Built with care by defcon. This is the first complete self-contained public-ready capsule.
